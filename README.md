camunda Cockpit Statistics Plugin
=================================

camunda BPM community extension, which provides a statistics plugin for camunda Cockpit.
This plugin provides a set of charts helping you to understand what is and what was going on with your engine.

## Get started

To include this plugin into your cockpit you can either include it in your custom build on [camunda's plugin store](http://camunda.org/plugins/) or you build the cockpit on your own and deploy it to your server.
Do not forget to customize build.properties in case you choose the latter option.

## Known issues

- Problems with queries on db2 
- Problems with "timing"-tab concerning a high count of activity or process instance start or end events

### Giving it a quick Try

If you want to have a quick look at this project, you can start a running instance of camunda BPM cockpit in the following way:

* Cone the project using git: `git clone https://github.com/camunda/camunda-cockpit-plugin-statistics.git`
* Start the camunda Webapp from the commandline: 

```bash
cd camunda-cockpit-plugin-statistics
mvn clean jetty:run -Pdevelop
```
* go to [http://localhost:8080/camunda](http://localhost:8080/camunda)
* Login with `demo:demo`

In Cockpit you will see a couple of plugins which display statistics about your process definitions and so on.
